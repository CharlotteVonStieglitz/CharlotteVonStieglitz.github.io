		<h2>Overall Knowledge and Skills</h2>
		<p>All teachers require a large variety of knowledge and skills to 
            effectively teach their students. Some knowledge and skills 
            will be the same across all teachers; however, to most effectively teach their 
			students their specific content areas the teacher may need additional skills and 
			knowledge. Stage 4 technology mandatory is no exception to this phenomenon.
		</p>
        <h2>Work Health and Safety</h2>
		<p>“Schools have a legal obligation in relation to safety. Teachers need 
            to ensure that they comply with relevant legislation as well as system 
            and school requirements in relation to safety and risk management when 
            implementing their programs.” (NESA, 2017, p21).
		</p>
        <p>Ensuring and maintaining adequate workplace health and safety is critical in 
			all aspects of life, professions and environments. The environment that technology 
			classes may be taught in are quite varied and unique.  Controlling the class in these 
			environments to ensure the safety of everyone is key.
		</p>
        <p>Technology classrooms are often a noisy environment that a mandatory technology teacher 
			must compete with. For example; conversations and the noise of collaboration and machinery 
			such as disk sanders and sewing machines. As a teacher, they need the skills and knowledge 
			to gain the attention of the students when necessary for both safety and educational purposes.
		</p>
        <h2>Preparing Students for the Real World</h2>
        <p>We live in a constantly changing world, with technology being one of the fastest-changing 
            areas. Teachers need to be both aware of these changes and have the skills and knowledge 
            to match these changes to best teach and prepare students. This may including retraining to 
			increase their skills and joining pages that inform teachers.
            Ultimately the goal is to prepare students for life after school.

        </p>
        <h2>Implementation of Practical Experiences</h2>
        <p>All sections of the stage 4 technology syllabus includes projects and practical skills, 
			often in the form of project-based learning. Due to this time management skills are 
			extremely crucial for a technology teacher. With this skills, they can demonstrate 
			time management habits to the students, pack up class with plenty of time, and manage
			 time so the students do not have to stop mid-task.
        </p>
        <p>“To satisfy the requirements of the syllabus, students must undertake a range of practical 
            experiences that occupy the majority of course time.” (NESA, 2017, p21)
        </p>
