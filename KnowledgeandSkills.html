		<h2>Overall Knowledge and Skills</h2>
		<p>All teachers require different knowledge and skills to 
            effectively teach their students. Some knowledge and skills 
            will be the same for all teachers; however, depending on 
            what is being taught, the teacher needs additional skills and 
            knowledge to most effectively teach their students their specific 
            content areas. Teaching stage 4 technology mandatory in NSW schools 
            is no exception.
		</p>
        <h2>Work Health and Safety</h2>
		<p>“Schools have a legal obligation in relation to safety. Teachers need 
            to ensure that they comply with relevant legislation as well as system 
            and school requirements in relation to safety and risk management when 
            implementing their programs.” (NESA, 2017, p21).
		</p>
        <p>Ensuring workplace health and safety is critical in all aspects of life, 
            and due to the unconventional environment technology classes are in, 
            being able to control the class to ensure the safety of everyone is key.
		</p>
        <p>With this, a mandatory technology teacher is often competing with noisy equipment, 
            conversation and the noise of collaboration. As a teacher, they need the skills 
            and knowledge to gain the attention of the students when necessary for both safety 
            and educational purposes.
		</p>
        <h2>Preparing Students for the Real World</h2>
        <p>We live in a constantly changing world. Technology is one of the fastest-changing 
            areas. Teachers need to be aware of these changes and have the skills and knowledge 
            to match the changes to best prepare students, including retraining to increase their skills. 
            Ultimately the goal is to prepare students for life after school.
        </p>
        <h2>Implementation of Practical Experiences</h2>
        <p>Project-based learning and practical skills are included in all sections of the mandatory 
            syllabus. This means that time management skills are even more crucial for a technology
            mandatory teacher to demonstrate this practice to the students, pack up class 
            with plenty of time, and manage time so the students don’t have to stop mid-task.
        </p>
        <p>“To satisfy the requirements of the syllabus, students must undertake a range of practical 
            experiences that occupy the majority of course time.” (NESA, 2017, p21)
        </p>
        <p>In addition to this, teachers should have a strong 
            understanding of the design and production process according to the Australian syllabus, including;
