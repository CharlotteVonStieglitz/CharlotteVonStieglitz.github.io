		<h2>Organisation of Content</h2>
		<p>Technology mandatory stage 4 (years 7-8) involves 4 areas; 
            material technologies, agriculture and food technologies, engineered systems 
            and digital technologies. (NSW Government, 2015). This builds from the k-6 
            content and lead/ support 7-10 electives.
		</p>
        <p>NSW has some form of flexibility regarding what they teach and how. This flexibility 
            can create many differences between the schools regarding technology. For example, 
            many schools will do textiles as part of material technology; however, when I went on practicum, 
            that school chose not to teach textiles and instead did metal. Another common difference is having the 
            agriculture and food technology areas be taught in one subject or split across more.
        </p>
        <p>Because of these differences in schools, teachers planning to teach stage 4 mandatory technology must be 
            adaptable when moving from school to school as their required skill set may need to adapt to the new environment.

        <p>Agriculture and food technologies is two areas merged into one, to best allow schools to deliver the 
            content in the way that best fits their school context and resources.
        </p>
        <p>Agriculture (food and fibre production) has a focus on learning about the process of food and fibre production. 
            According to acara (2015) students “analyse how food and fibre are produced when designing managed environments 
            and how these can become more sustainable (ACTDEK032).” (acara, 2015, p1). With all this, there are also investigations 
            on the innovative and sustainable supply of raw materials. Managed environments are a key focus of this section of the syllabus, 
            for example farms and plantations. Teachers will have to have an understanding of food and fibre production in managed environments 
            and the factors involved with supplying raw materials.
        </p>
        <p>Food technologies is aimed more at the use of these resources for sustaining human life. This involves the characteristics and properties of food, 
            food selection and preparation, safety and making informed choices. (NESA, 2017). acara states that students, “analyse how characteristics 
            and properties of food determine preparation techniques and presentation when designing solutions for healthy eating (ACTDEK033).” (acara, 2015, p1). 
            Teachers planning to teach this area need to understand the characteristics and properties of food and how this is involved with making informed choices.
        </p>
        <p>For agriculture and food technologies, teachers need to have the knowledge and skills to help support students’ investigations and production of projects that 
            support the students learning in agriculture and food.
        </p>

        <p>
            “The Material Technologies context focuses on the application of specialist skills and techniques to a broad range of 
            traditional, contemporary and advancing materials.” (NSW Government, 2017, p37). Teachers need the knowledge and skills 
            in specialised areas to support students in the creation of products that meet “identified needs and opportunities.” (NESA, 2017, p37). 
            Students are expected to develop an understanding of a range of materials through both projects and experimentation, research 
            and practical investigation. These develop their understanding of the characteristics and properties of the materials 
            investigated. Teachers need practical skills and knowledge to ensure the students experiment safely and are producing 
            relevant and informative projects.
        </p>

            <img src="images/EngeneringSmbol.png" width="100px" />
        </div>

        <p>Teachers teaching engineered systems should have a strong understanding of how motion, force and energy work. 
            This is in terms of how these factors control and manipulate electromechanical systems. 
            According to the NSW syllabus students “understand how forces and the properties of materials affect the 
            behaviour and performance of engineered systems, machines and structures.” (NESA, 2017, p34). A teacher 
            should have this same understanding. Teachers need to be able to help support students to prototype, 
            design and produce sustainable solutions.
        </p>

            <div class="textTech"><h2>Digital Technology</h2></div>
            <img src="images/CompterSymbol2.png" width="100px" />
        </div>
        <p>Digital technologies involve using “abstractions to represent and decompose real-world
            problems, and implement and evaluate digital solutions.” (NSW Government, 2017, p31). Teachers should have the 
            knowledge and skills to support their students in these endeavours. As “students are provided with opportunities 
            to develop fluency in a general-purpose programming language,” (NESA, 2017, p31). A teacher should know such a
            language and have the skills to teach the students the programming language. It is require that 
            “digital technologies must be delivered for a minimum of 50 indicative hours by the end of stage 4.” (NESA, 2017, p31).
