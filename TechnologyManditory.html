		<h2>Organisation of Content</h2>
		<p>Technology mandatory stage 4 (years 7-8) involves 4 areas; 
            material technologies, agriculture and food technologies, engineered systems 
            and digital technologies. (NSW Government, 2015). This builds from content found within 
            k-6 and lead up to and supports elective subjects for 7-10.

		</p>
        <p>The different states have some form of flexibility regarding what they teach and how, including NSW. 
            This flexibility can create many differences between schools across Australian and NSW  
            regarding technology. For example, many schools may choose to do textiles as part of 
            material technoly while othes do not such as the schools I have been to as a practicum
             teacher where they both chose not to teach textiles but did metalwork instead.
            Another common difference is how schools chose to teach agriculture and food 
            technology, whether that be withing one subject or split across more.
            
        </p>
        <p>Because of school differences, teachers planning to teach stage 4 mandatory technology 
            must be highly adaptable when moving from school to school. Their required 
            skill set may need to adapt to the new subjects and environment they find themselves in.

        <p>To allow schools to deliver the content in the way they best see fit, Agriculture and food 
            technologies is two areas merged into one. This helps the school fit the content 
            better within their school context and resources.
        </p>
        <p>Agriculture (food and fibre production) has a focus on learning about the production and process of food and fibre.
            According to acara (2015) students “analyse how food and fibre are produced when designing managed environments 
            and how these can become more sustainable (ACTDEK032).” (acara, 2015, p1). Many investigations are conducted on the innovative and sustainable supply of raw materials. 
            Managed environments are a key focus of this section of the syllabus, 
            for example farms and plantations. In order to best teach and deliver this content, teachers will have to have an understanding of food and fibre production in managed environments 
            and the factors involved with supplying raw materials.

        </p>
        <p>Food technologies is aimed at the use of these resources for sustaining human life, including the characteristics and properties of food, safety and making informed choices and food selection and preparation, (NESA, 2017). ACARA states that students, “analyse how characteristics 
            and properties of food determine preparation techniques and presentation when designing solutions for healthy eating (ACTDEK033).” (acara, 2015, p1). 
            Teachers planning to teach this area need to understand the characteristics and properties of food and how this is involved with making informed choices.

            “The Material Technologies context focuses on the application of specialist skills and techniques 
            to a broad range of traditional, contemporary and advancing materials.” (NSW Government, 2017, p37).
             Teachers need the knowledge and skills in specific, specialised areas to support students in the 
             creation of products that meet “identified needs and opportunities.” (NESA, 2017, p37). 
            Students develop an understanding of a range and variety of materials both through projects 
            and experimentation, practical investigation and research. To ensure the students experiment 
            safely and are producing relevant and informative projects, teachers need practical skills and knowledge.

        <div class="headTech">
            <img src="images/EngeneringSmbol.png" width="100px" /> <!-- two images on eather side in line with the text-->
            <div class="textTech"><h2>Engineered Systems</h2></div>
            <img src="images/EngeneringSmbol.png" width="100px" />
        </div>

        <p>Teachers teaching engineered systems should have a strong understanding of how motion, force and energy work, 
            in terms of how these factors control and manipulate electromechanical systems. 
            According to the NSW syllabus students “understand how forces and the properties of 
            materials affect the behaviour and performance of engineered systems, machines and structures.” (NESA, 2017, p34).
             Teachers need to be able to help support students to prototype, design and produce sustainable solutions.

        <div class="headTech">
            <img src="images/CompterSymbol2.png" width="100px" /> <!-- two images on eather side in line with the text-->
            <div class="textTech"><h2>Digital Technology</h2></div>
            <img src="images/CompterSymbol2.png" width="100px" />
        </div>
        <p>Digital technologies involve using “abstractions to represent and decompose real-world
            problems, and implement and evaluate digital solutions.” (NSW Government, 2017, p31). 
            Teachers should have the knowledge and skills to support their students in this. 
            As “students are provided with opportunities to develop fluency in a general-purpose programming language,” 
            (NESA, 2017, p31)  A teacher should know such a language for example python, and 
            have the skills to teach the students this programming language.
